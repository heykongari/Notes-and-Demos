# ‚ùì **What is AWS CLI?**

The AWS command line interface (cli) is a tool that lets you interact with aws services using commands in your terminal or shell.

Instead of clicking around the aws management console, you can run commands like:
```python
aws s3 ls
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
aws iam create-user --user-name demo-user
```
It works across multiple operating systems and supports scripting which makes it a powerful tool for automation.
